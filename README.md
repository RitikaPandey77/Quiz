# Quiz

Inspired by the famous TV show Kon Bnega Carorpati, I created this project to challenge and inspire new and enthusiastic software programming language learners to test thier knowledge about the language. The quis has 10 questions each and has questions on three languages :-
1. Python
2. C
3. Java

You may select the language to start the quiz.

Python has a vast library support to perform almost every task in field of computer science. Out of those I had used few of the libraries ( actually one ) in order to create a user intephase.

Libraries used:-
1. Tkinter(Documentation:- https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html)

The questions in the quiz have been collected by people who had excelled in the field so there is no reason for argumentation. 

I have used file handeling or rather inheritance to get the questions of the quiz.
To replace this one may use a database also but since it was not benefetial in my case so I avoided it. 


I hope you will enjoy playing it.
I learned a lot making this project and more than that while playing it, hope it will teach you the same....

## Enjoyyy...........
